REALTIME QUIZ
-------------

What is it?
-----------
This is a type of quiz designed to be used in face-to-face lessons, with a classroom full of computers.
The teacher creates the quiz in advance - adding multiple-choice questions, with a range of answers (and indicating which is the correct answer).

During the lesson, the teacher starts the quiz (optionally giving the quiz a 'session name'). Students can now connect to this quiz. Once the teacher is satisfied that all students have connected to the quiz, they can click on 'Next' to show the first question. The question will be displayed for a pre-defined amount of time, after which the correct answer will be displayed, along with a count of how many students gave each answer. The teacher can then discuss the question, before clicking on 'Next' to show the next question. Once all the questions have been shown, the final result for the class is displayed.

The teacher can, at a later date, go back through the results and, for each question, see exactly what answer each student gave.
